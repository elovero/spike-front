      '_\n# ALG_YASS\n\n## Description\n\nFrom the YASS bioRxiv paper [2]: This manuscript describes an efficient, reliable pipeline for spike sorting on dense multi-electrode arrays (MEAs), where neural signals appear across many electrodes and spike sorting currently represents a major computational bottleneck. We present several new techniques that make dense MEA spike sorting more robust and scalable. Our pipeline is based on an efficient multi-stage \u201ctriage-then-cluster-then-pursuit\u201d approach that initially extracts only clean, high-quality waveforms from the electrophysiological time series by temporarily skipping noisy or \u201ccollided\u201d events (representing two neurons firing synchronously). This is accomplished by developing a neural network detection method followed by efficient outlier triaging. The clean waveforms are then used to infer the set of neural spike waveform templates through nonparametric Bayesian clustering. Our clustering approach adapts a \u201ccoreset\u201d approach for data reduction and uses efficient inference methods in a Dirichlet process mixture model framework to dramatically improve the scalability and reliability of the entire pipeline. The \u201ctriaged\u201d waveforms are then finally recovered with matching-pursuit deconvolution techniques. The proposed methods improve on the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and stability on both real and biophysically-realistic simulated MEA data. Furthermore, the proposed pipeline is efficient, learning templates and clustering much faster than real-time for a \u2243 500-electrode dataset, using primarily a single CPU core.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Lee, Jin Hyung, et al.
